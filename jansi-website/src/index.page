    Jansi is a small ASl 2.0 licensed Java library that allows you to use ANSI escape sequences 
    to format your console output which works even on windows.  

    Using jansi is easy.  Before you start sending ANSI escape sequences to
    `System.out` make sure you run:
        
    {pygmentize::java}
    AnsiConsole.systemInstall();
    {pygmentize}

  :markdown
    If you would rather not mess with the System.out settings, you can use the
    `AnsiConsole.out` PrintStream instead.  For example:
    
    {pygmentize::java}
    AnsiConsole.out.println("Hello World");
    {pygmentize}

    Most unix terminals support rendering ANSI escape sequences when Java
    sends them via `System.out` but when this is done on Windows, they 
    don't get interpreted and you get garbage on the console similar to:

    If the application uses the jansi libary, things start to look
    much better:
