# How to Build ${project_name}
The way most developers get started contributing to a project.

--- name:content 

## Building with Maven

${project_name} uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) as its primary
build tool for performing releases and uses the pom.xml to describe
dependencies between modules.

### Prequisites

*Required:*

* Java 1.6
* Download and [install Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Get the latest [source](source.html)

### Maven options

To build ${project_name} maven has to be configured to use more memory

    set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m

### A normal build

    mvn install

Once the build completes, you will find the jar of 
${project_name} located in the `target` directory.


### Doing a Quick Build

The following avoids running all the unit test cases, we just skip the
test running phase and not the building part

    mvn -Dtest=false install

### Using an IDE

If you prefer to use an IDE then you can auto-generate the IDE's project
files using maven plugins. e.g.

    mvn eclipse:eclipse
        
or      
        
    mvn idea:idea

### Importing into Eclipse

If you have not already done so, you will need to make Eclipse aware of
the Maven repository so that it can build everything. In the preferences,
go to `Java -> Build Path -> Classpath` and define a new Classpath
Variable named `M2_REPO` that points to your local Maven repository. i.e.
`~/.m2/repository` on Unix and `c:\Documents and Settings\$username\.m2\repository` 
on Windows).

You can also get Maven to do this for you:

    mvn eclipse:add-maven-repo -Declipse.workspace=/path/to/the/workspace/
