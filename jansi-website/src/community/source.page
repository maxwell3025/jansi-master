    #{project_name} stores its source code in a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository hosted on [github](http://github.com) at this location:

    * [#{github_page}](#{github_page})

    If you are new to Git you might like to try the [Git guide for subversion users](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html) or have a look at the [Git community book](http://book.git-scm.com/).

    Read only access to the repository is available at the following URL:

    * **#{git_user_url}**

    You must first install a [Git client](http://git-scm.com/download). Then you clone the repository using the following:

        git clone #{git_user_url}
        cd #{project_id}

    Now you probably want to try [build the ${project_name} code](building.html)
