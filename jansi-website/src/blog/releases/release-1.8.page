The [${project_name}](${website_base_url}) project is pleased to announce
the availability of ${project_name} 1.8. Jansi is a small java library that allows 
you to use ANSI escape sequences to format your console output which works 
even on windows.

Changes:

* Updated bundled native libraries
  * Windows: Added support for isatty and link against the system msvcrt.dll (so no need for VC redistributables)
* Add some helper methods to turn bold on and off
* if the jansi.passthrough system property is set, then jansi will not interpret any of the ansi sequences.

Further information:
