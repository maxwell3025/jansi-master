  ## Development Snapshot

  Want to help stablize the latest and greatest nightly development
  build?  **Warnning**: This build may be extremely bleeding edge!

table.download
  tr 
    td 
      a(href="http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.fusesource.#{project_id}&a=#{project_id}&v=#{project_snapshot_version}&e=jar") #{project_id}-#{project_snapshot_version}.jar

  The development build source code should be directly checked out from our [source code repository](community/source.html)
